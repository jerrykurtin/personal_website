                Howdy! I'm Jerry, a computer science student at <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Texas A&M</a>. I have a passion for working as a team to bring out people's unique talents, and I love constructive discomfort - putting myself into situations that require leaving my comfort zone and learning new skills.
                My coding journey started when I created my high school's first coding club, a group that met weekly and learned to code through websites like <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codecademy</a>. 
                After high school, I worked at a navy research contractor called  <a href="https://www.arlut.utexas.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applied Research Laboratories</a>, where I used computer vision to classify whale calls and studied computer vision's vulnerability to malicious manipulation, attacking my models and rebuilding them to be less vulnerable to attacks.

                <br/><br/>In college, I've done research at the Texas A&M DIVE Lab. In January 2023, I was a co-author of the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Learning Protein Representations via Complete 3D Graph Networks,”</a> which was accepted into <a href="https://iclr.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICLR</a>, a premier machine learning conference.
                In part of a recent project on PDEs, I replicated <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this state-of-the-art paper's</a> performance with a <strong>3.18x</strong> speed increase.
                
                <br/><br/>I've also competed in some incredible contests at my university. In the Spring of 2022, I competed in Aggies Invent for First Responders, a 48-hour design competition. <a href="https://github.com/jerrykurtin/PerilScope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My team made PerilScope</a>, an intelligent monitoring system for police vehicles, and we placed <strong>1st</strong> out of <strong>14 teams</strong>. 
                In the Fall of 2023, I competed in TAMUHack, one of the largest hackathons in Texas. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/flock-9yb8iq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My team made Flock</a>, an app to help travelers make the most of their layovers, and we placed <strong>3rd</strong> out of <strong>32 teams</strong> in the American Airlines Challenge.

                <br/><br/>In the summer of 2022, I interned at The Home Depot in the payments division. I built a brand-new microservice to process check payments across all stores, replacing an outdated service with one that was more robust, more secure, easier to maintain, and easier to detect and solve problems.
                I can't wait to apply my attention to detail and creativity to new domains. If you're interested in getting in contact, connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-kurtin">LinkedIn</a>!
